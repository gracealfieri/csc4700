What is your favorite movie?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
The beaches of Zanzibar in Tanzania, Africa.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
To be able to read peoples' minds. I always wonder what people are actually thinking compared to what they say. You wouldn't have to worry about people lying to you or withholding the truth. It would allow you to figure out things before anyone realizes what is going on.
